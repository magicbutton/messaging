3. Follow Claude's guidance to create a complete React chat application
4. Use the provided example code patterns as a reference for implementation

## Architecture

The starter promotes a clean architecture with:

1. **Contract Module**: Defines all events, requests, and permissions
2. **Transport Layer**: In-memory transport for local development
3. **Server API**: Backend service handling requests and broadcasting events
